# nmr_data_extractor

**nmr_data_extractor** is a project focused on the automatic extraction of spectroscopic data from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra images. By combining advanced **computer vision techniques** with **supervised learning algorithms** such as **KNN** and **SVM**, the system enables the detection, recognition, and interpretation of key information from both 1D and 2D spectra. The processing pipeline includes **image preprocessing**, **optical character recognition (OCR)**, and **object detection**, facilitating the structural elucidation of small organic molecules.

## Features

- Automatic extraction of data from 1D and 2D NMR spectra images.
- Integration of computer vision and supervised learning techniques (KNN, SVM).
- Image preprocessing, OCR, and object detection for accurate data interpretation.
- Structural elucidation of small organic molecules.
